# Weather-App-HTML-CSS-JavaScript
As a web developer, I crafted a Weather App utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on frontend development. The single-page application allows users to select a city and view its current forecast. Leveraging HTML elements and attributes, along with CSS styling for aesthetic appeal, I designed various containers to display temperature and city information. JavaScript functions power the interaction, updating data dynamically when users input their city details and press the button. The project includes;
1. HTML Elements
2. HTML Attributes
3. CSS Selectors
4. HTML Classes
5. CSS Properties
6. CSS Colors
7. Color Palletes
8. CSS Positioning
9. CSS Spacing
10. CSS Borders/ Margin/ Padding
11. CSS Pseudo-selectors
12. HTML Container Elements
13. JavaScript Functions
14. JavaScript Selector
15. JavaScript Event
